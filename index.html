		<h1>Hey, I'm Andrzej Tuchołka :)</h1>

	<article>
		<p>
			I wear a few hats - Software Architect, Developer, and Tech Entrepreneur.
			Love computer/systems/software engineering? Me too!

		<p>I've built a variety of software products that millions of people use. 
			We're talking about Spain's largest social network with over 10 million users, 
			a video streaming platform, marketing and automation tools. 
			I've also ventured into consulting and process management solutions.

		<p>What do I bring to the table? A mix of software engineering and management consulting.
			I've been the leading tech guy for several startups across EU and US.

		<p>I got some degrees that I'm proud of:
		<ul>
			<li>PhD in Engineering and Technology: antipatterns and using neural models to assess machine construction
			<li>MSc & BEng in Computer Systems Design
		</ul>

		<p>I'm fluent in a bunch of programming languages, but what gets me excited is functional and declarative programming.
			They're not just expressive; they make scaling software production a breeze.

		<p>I'm not just passionate about technology; I channel it into building and running innovative companies. 
			Each venture is a unique playground where I get to experiment, create, and make an impact. Here's a quick rundown:

		<p><a href="https://memeticblock.com" target="_blank">Memetic Block</a> is a boutique development team focused on blockchain products.

		<p><a href="https://www.fitmech.com" target="_blank">FitMech</a> is all about intelligence for industry - manufacturing analytics, helping factories become more efficient, and profitable.
		
		<p><a href="https://astronation.world" target="_blank">Astronation</a> is a virtual world where reality meets imagination. It's an entertainment platform mixing creator economy with new technology.

		<p><a href="https://www.yexperiment.com" target="_blank">Y Experiment</a> is my launchpad for groundbreaking ideas. It is an incubator for concepts that have the potential to evolve into full-fledged companies.
