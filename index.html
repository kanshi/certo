			I am passionate about engineering, innovation, human intelligence and cognitive processes.
			I'm a fan of decentralized decision making and its role in making the world a more balanced and peaceful place to live in.	
		<p>I am currently building software for VR and industrial manufacturing:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.fitmech.com/" target="_blank">FitMech</a> - Industrial IoT platform for lean manufacturing.
			<li><a href="https://astronation.world/" target="_blank">Astronation</a> - a VR native, holistic, virtual world simulation.
		</ul>
		<p>My education path is about using software to solve engineering problems:
		<ul>
			<li>PhD in Engineering and Technology (with honors) - <em>A methodology for assessing the construction of machine elements using neural models and antipatterns</em>.
			<li>MSc, BEng in Design of Computer Systems (with honors) - <em>System detecting and aiding in presentation of computer fraud</em>.
		</ul>

		<p>My expertise in grounded in software engineering and management consulting. I have managed and built several EU startups in the role of a hands-on CTO/Architect - building core frameworks, supporting developers, establishing technical operations, promoting best practices, implementing information security and management standards <em>(eg. ISO/IEC 27000, PCI-DSS)</em>.
		<p>Software products I've been building in the past, range from a largest Spanish social network <em>(10M+ users)</em>, through a video streaming platform <em>(5K+ films)</em>, video-ads and marketing automation tools <em>(startup awards, 2xFMP)</em> to workflow and process management tools used by thousands of companies including government agencies, international corporations, and heavy industry firms.
		<p>I have worked with many programming languages and frameworks including <em>Scala, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Delphi, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go</em>... in particular I enjoy functional and declarative programming for their expressiveness and the simplification of software engineering processes at scale.
