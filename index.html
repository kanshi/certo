		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I'm a technology entrepreneur, software architect passionate about engineering, innovation, and cognitive processes.<br/>
			My professional activity (<a href="http://www.yexperiment.com/" title="Homepage of my company - Y Experiment">Y&nbsp;Experiment</a>) is related to identifying emerging technologies, and materializing business opportunities they present.<br/>
			My scientific activity is about identifying antipatterns and proposing systematic solutions enabling global transfer of knowledge using information technology.
	
		<p>In particular, I'm focused now on software innovation in the manufacturing, virtual reality, social, and crypto:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.fitmech.com/" target="_blank" title="Homepage of FitMech">FitMech</a> - Industry 4.0 platform for lean manufacturing
			<li><a href="https://astronation.world/" target="_blank" title="Homepage of Astronation">Astronation</a> - a VR native, holistic, sandbox virtual world
			<li><a href="https://love4src.com/" target="_blank" title="Homepage of love4src">Love4src</a> - BitClout based social network by and for software makers 
		</ul>
		<h2>Lets talk?</h2>
		<p>Here are some of the topics that I'd like to learn more about in the near future. Let me know if you have any insights or expertise on these, I'll be happy to learn and exchange ideas with you.
		<ul>
			<li>Automated processing of kinetic and electromagnetic signals
			<li>Low level software for high-performance GPU calculations
			<li>Artificial Life, General Intelligence
		</ul>
		<p>In addition to the commercial activity, I do research on antipatterns and their applications aiming to increase the wellbeing and productivity of people.
